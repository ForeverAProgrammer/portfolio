# Programming Languages

Master the programming languages that power modern software development. From Java's enterprise strength to JavaScript's web ubiquity to TypeScript's type safety, find comprehensive guides for each language.

## Available Languages

### [Java](./java/)
Enterprise-grade, object-oriented programming language known for "write once, run anywhere" capability.

**What you'll learn:**
- Java fundamentals and best practices
- Testing with JUnit 5
- Build tools (Gradle, Maven)

**Best for:** Enterprise applications, Android development, large-scale systems

---

### [JavaScript](./javascript/)
The language of the web - runs in browsers and on servers with Node.js.

**What you'll learn:**
- ES6+ modern JavaScript features
- Async programming (Promises, async/await)
- Modules and code organization
- Build tools (Webpack, Vite)

**Best for:** Web development, server-side with Node.js, full-stack applications

---

### [TypeScript](./typescript/)
JavaScript with static typing - scales from small scripts to large applications.

**What you'll learn:**
- Type system and type safety
- Interfaces, types, and generics
- Advanced TypeScript patterns
- TypeScript configuration

**Best for:** Large-scale applications, teams, projects requiring type safety

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Java | JavaScript | TypeScript |
|---------|------|------------|------------|
| **Typing** | Static | Dynamic | Static |
| **Compilation** | Compiled to bytecode | Interpreted | Transpiled to JavaScript |
| **Primary Use** | Backend, Enterprise | Frontend, Full-stack | Frontend, Full-stack |
| **Learning Curve** | Moderate | Easy | Moderate |
| **Performance** | Excellent | Good | Good (same as JS) |
| **Ecosystem** | Mature | Massive | Growing rapidly |
| **Popularity** | Very High | Highest | Rising fast |

## Choosing a Language

### Choose Java if:
- Building enterprise applications
- Developing Android apps
- Need strong typing and performance
- Working on large-scale backend systems
- Existing Java ecosystem and libraries

### Choose JavaScript if:
- Building web applications
- Need to run in browsers
- Want rapid prototyping
- Full-stack development with Node.js
- Accessing the massive npm ecosystem

### Choose TypeScript if:
- Building large-scale applications
- Want type safety with JavaScript flexibility
- Working in a team (better code documentation)
- Using Angular, React, or Vue at scale
- Need better IDE support and refactoring

## Learning Paths

### Frontend Developer Path
1. Start with [JavaScript fundamentals](./javascript/fundamentals/)
2. Learn modern frameworks ([React](../frameworks/react/), [Angular](../frameworks/angular/))
3. Add [TypeScript](./typescript/) for type safety
4. Master [testing](../testing/) and build tools

### Backend Developer Path
1. Start with [Java fundamentals](./java/fundamentals/)
2. Learn [testing with JUnit](./java/testing/)
3. Master [build tools](./java/build-tools/) (Gradle, Maven)
4. Explore frameworks (Spring, Jakarta EE)

### Full-Stack Developer Path
1. Learn [JavaScript fundamentals](./javascript/fundamentals/)
2. Master both frontend frameworks and Node.js
3. Add [TypeScript](./typescript/) for full-stack type safety
4. Learn database and deployment

## Common Concepts Across Languages

All these languages share fundamental programming concepts:

- **Variables and Data Types**
- **Functions/Methods**
- **Control Flow** (if/else, loops)
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Error Handling**
- **Modules/Packages**
- **Testing**
- **Build Tools**

Once you master one language, learning others becomes much easier!

## Testing Your Code

Every language needs testing. Visit our [Testing section](../testing/) for:
- Language-specific testing guides
- Testing best practices (TDD, BDD)
- Test doubles and mocking
- Integration and E2E testing

## Related Topics

- **[Frameworks](../frameworks/)** - React, Angular, Vue
- **[Testing](../testing/)** - Unit, integration, E2E testing
- **[Design Patterns](../design-patterns/)** - Reusable solutions
- **[DevOps](../devops/)** - CI/CD, containers, deployment
- **[Web Development](../web-development/)** - HTML, CSS, HTTP fundamentals

## Getting Started

Pick a language and dive in:

1. **New to programming?** Start with [JavaScript](./javascript/) - it's beginner-friendly and widely used
2. **Coming from another language?** Check out the language-specific guides for syntax and idioms
3. **Building enterprise apps?** Explore [Java](./java/) for robust, scalable solutions
4. **Want type safety?** Learn [TypeScript](./typescript/) for better tooling and fewer bugs
