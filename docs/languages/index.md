# Programming Languages

Master the programming languages that power modern software development. From Go's simplicity and concurrency to Java's enterprise strength to JavaScript's web ubiquity to TypeScript's type safety, find comprehensive guides for each language.

## Available Languages

### [Go](./go/)
Modern, efficient programming language designed for simplicity and high-performance concurrent systems.

**What you'll learn:**
- Go fundamentals and syntax
- Output and string formatting
- Package management
- Standard library usage

**Best for:** Cloud services, microservices, DevOps tools, concurrent systems

---

### [Java](./java/)
Enterprise-grade, object-oriented programming language known for "write once, run anywhere" capability.

**What you'll learn:**
- Java fundamentals and best practices
- Testing with JUnit 5
- Build tools (Gradle, Maven)

**Best for:** Enterprise applications, Android development, large-scale systems

---

### [JavaScript](./javascript/fundamentals/)
The language of the web - runs in browsers and on servers with Node.js.

**What you'll learn:**
- ES6+ modern JavaScript features
- Async programming (Promises, async/await)
- Modules and code organization
- Build tools (Webpack, Vite)

**Best for:** Web development, server-side with Node.js, full-stack applications

---

### [TypeScript](./typescript/fundamentals/)
JavaScript with static typing - scales from small scripts to large applications.

**What you'll learn:**
- Type system and type safety
- Interfaces, types, and generics
- Advanced TypeScript patterns
- TypeScript configuration

**Best for:** Large-scale applications, teams, projects requiring type safety

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Go | Java | JavaScript | TypeScript |
|---------|-------|------|------------|------------|
| **Typing** | Static | Static | Dynamic | Static |
| **Compilation** | Compiled to binary | Compiled to bytecode | Interpreted | Transpiled to JavaScript |
| **Primary Use** | Backend, Systems | Backend, Enterprise | Frontend, Full-stack | Frontend, Full-stack |
| **Learning Curve** | Easy | Moderate | Easy | Moderate |
| **Performance** | Excellent | Excellent | Good | Good (same as JS) |
| **Concurrency** | Built-in (goroutines) | Threads | Event loop | Event loop |
| **Ecosystem** | Growing | Mature | Massive | Growing rapidly |
| **Popularity** | Rising fast | Very High | Highest | Rising fast |

## Choosing a Language

### Choose Go if:
- Building cloud services or microservices
- Need excellent concurrency support
- Creating CLI tools or DevOps utilities
- Want fast compilation and execution
- Building distributed systems

### Choose Java if:
- Building enterprise applications
- Developing Android apps
- Need strong typing and performance
- Working on large-scale backend systems
- Existing Java ecosystem and libraries

### Choose JavaScript if:
- Building web applications
- Need to run in browsers
- Want rapid prototyping
- Full-stack development with Node.js
- Accessing the massive npm ecosystem

### Choose TypeScript if:
- Building large-scale applications
- Want type safety with JavaScript flexibility
- Working in a team (better code documentation)
- Using Angular, React, or Vue at scale
- Need better IDE support and refactoring

## Learning Paths

### Frontend Developer Path
1. Start with [JavaScript fundamentals](./javascript/fundamentals/)
2. Learn modern frameworks ([React](../frameworks/react/), [Angular](../frameworks/angular/))
3. Add [TypeScript](./typescript/fundamentals/) for type safety
4. Master [testing](../testing/) and build tools

### Backend Developer Path (Java)
1. Start with [Java fundamentals](./java/fundamentals/)
2. Learn [testing with JUnit](./java/testing/junit5)
3. Master [build tools](./java/build-tools/gradle) (Gradle, Maven)
4. Explore frameworks (Spring, Jakarta EE)

### Backend Developer Path (Go)
1. Start with [Go fundamentals](./go/fundamentals/)
2. Learn Go standard library packages
3. Master goroutines and concurrency
4. Build CLI tools and web services

### Full-Stack Developer Path
1. Learn [JavaScript fundamentals](./javascript/fundamentals/)
2. Master both frontend frameworks and Node.js
3. Add [TypeScript](./typescript/fundamentals/) for full-stack type safety
4. Learn database and deployment

## Common Concepts Across Languages

All these languages share fundamental programming concepts:

- **Variables and Data Types**
- **Functions/Methods**
- **Control Flow** (if/else, loops)
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **Error Handling**
- **Modules/Packages**
- **Testing**
- **Build Tools**

Once you master one language, learning others becomes much easier!

## Testing Your Code

Every language needs testing. Visit our [Testing section](../testing/) for:
- Language-specific testing guides
- Testing best practices (TDD, BDD)
- Test doubles and mocking
- Integration and E2E testing

- **[Web Development](../web-development/)** - HTML, CSS, HTTP fundamentals

## Getting Started

Pick a language and dive in:

1. **New to programming?** Start with [Go](./go/) or [JavaScript](./javascript/fundamentals/) - both are beginner-friendly
2. **Building cloud services?** Explore [Go](./go/) for fast, concurrent systems
3. **Building enterprise apps?** Explore [Java](./java/) for robust, scalable solutions
4. **Want type safety?** Learn [TypeScript](./typescript/fundamentals/) for better tooling and fewer bugs
5. **Coming from another language?** Check out the language-specific guides for syntax and idioms
