# Testing

Write reliable, maintainable tests for your Java applications using modern testing frameworks and best practices.

## What's Covered

This section covers testing frameworks, methodologies, and best practices for ensuring your Java code is reliable and maintainable.

## Topics

### JUnit 5 Testing Framework
Modern testing with JUnit 5 (Jupiter) for Java applications.

**You'll learn:**
- **JUnit 5 Architecture**
  - JUnit Platform, Jupiter, and Vintage modules
  - Modern Java 8+ features
  - Flexible extension model

- **Gradle Integration**
  - Configuring JUnit 5 in build.gradle
  - Managing test dependencies
  - Running tests with Gradle

- **Writing Tests**
  - Basic test structure with @Test
  - Assertions and test lifecycle
  - Parameterized and dynamic tests
  - Test organization and naming

- **Advanced Features**
  - Mocking with Mockito
  - Test coverage with JaCoCo
  - Parallel test execution

## Why Testing Matters

### Code Quality
- Catch bugs early in development
- Ensure code behaves as expected
- Prevent regressions when refactoring

### Confidence
- Deploy with confidence
- Refactor without fear
- Document expected behavior

### Maintainability
- Tests serve as documentation
- Easier to onboard new developers
- Validate assumptions

## Testing Philosophy

Effective tests are:
- **Fast** - Run quickly to encourage frequent execution
- **Isolated** - Independent of other tests
- **Repeatable** - Same results every time
- **Self-validating** - Pass or fail clearly
- **Timely** - Written alongside code

## Getting Started

### For Beginners
1. Set up JUnit 5 with Gradle
2. Write your first unit test
3. Learn basic assertions
4. Practice writing tests regularly

### For Experienced Developers
Use this as:
- Reference for JUnit 5 features
- Guide for Gradle test configuration
- Best practices for test organization

## Next Steps

After mastering testing basics, explore:
- **Advanced Mockito** - Complex mocking scenarios
- **Test Coverage Analysis** - Interpret JaCoCo reports
- **Performance Testing** - Load and stress testing
- **Test-Driven Development** - Write tests first methodology
