# Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

## Patterns

- **[Singleton](./singleton)** - Ensure a class has only one instance
- **[Factory Method](./factory-method)** - Define an interface for creating objects
- **[Abstract Factory](./abstract-factory)** - Create families of related objects
