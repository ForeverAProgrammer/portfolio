# Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns deal with object collaboration and delegation, focusing on how objects interact and distribute responsibility.

## Patterns

- **[Strategy](./strategy)** - Define a family of algorithms and make them interchangeable
- **[Observer](./observer)** - Define one-to-many dependency between objects
- **[Command](./command)** - Encapsulate a request as an object
- **[Template Method](./template-method)** - Define skeleton of algorithm in base class
- **[Iterator](./iterator)** - Access elements of collection sequentially
- **[State](./state)** - Allow object to alter behavior when internal state changes
- **[Chain of Responsibility](./chain-of-responsibility)** - Pass request along a chain of handlers until one handles it
