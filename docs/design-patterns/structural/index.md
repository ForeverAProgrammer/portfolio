# Structural Patterns

Structural patterns deal with object composition and structure, helping to ensure that when parts of a system change, the entire structure doesn't need to change.

## Patterns

- **[Decorator](./decorator)** - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
- **[Adapter](./adapter)** - Convert interface of class into another interface
- **[Facade](./facade)** - Provide unified interface to subsystem
- **[Composite](./composite)** - Compose objects into tree structures
- **[Proxy](./proxy)** - Provide surrogate or placeholder for another object
