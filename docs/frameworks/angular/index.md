Angular is a complete framework for building dynamic web applications with TypeScript. Developed and maintained by Google, it provides everything you need out of the box for enterprise-scale applications.

## What You'll Learn

### [Fundamentals](./fundamentals/)
Master Angular core concepts and architecture.

**Topics covered:**
- Components and templates
- Services and dependency injection
- Lifecycle hooks
- Forms (template-driven and reactive)
- Routing and navigation
- RxJS and reactive programming
- HTTP client and observables

### [Testing](./angular-testing)
Write comprehensive tests for your Angular applications.

**Topics covered:**
- Jasmine testing framework
- Karma test runner
- TestBed for component testing
- Service testing
- End-to-end testing with Protractor/Cypress

### Ecosystem
Explore the Angular ecosystem.

**Coming soon:**
- Angular Material UI components
- NgRx state management
- Angular Universal for SSR
- Performance optimization

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Angular CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli

# Create a new Angular app
ng new my-app
cd my-app

# Serve the application
ng serve

# Navigate to http://localhost:4200/
```

## Why Angular?
