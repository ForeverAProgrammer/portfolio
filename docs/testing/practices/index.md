# Testing Practices

Master advanced testing methodologies and patterns to write better, more maintainable tests. Learn industry-standard practices like TDD and how to use test doubles effectively.

## What You'll Learn

### [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](./tdd)
Learn the Red-Green-Refactor cycle and how writing tests first leads to better design.

**You'll learn:**
- The TDD workflow
- Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Benefits of TDD
- Common TDD patterns
- When to use TDD

### [Test Doubles](./test-doubles)
Master mocks, stubs, spies, and fakes for effective unit testing.

**You'll learn:**
- What are test doubles
- Mocks vs Stubs vs Spies vs Fakes
- When to use each type
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls

## Why Advanced Testing Practices Matter

### Code Quality
- **Better Design** - TDD encourages testable, modular code
- **Clear Intent** - Tests document expected behavior
- **Faster Feedback** - Catch issues early in development

### Maintainability
- **Refactoring Safety** - Tests catch regressions
- **Living Documentation** - Tests show how code should work
- **Team Alignment** - Shared understanding of requirements

### Productivity
- **Faster Debugging** - Failing tests pinpoint issues
- **Confidence** - Make changes without fear
- **Less Rework** - Catch bugs before production

## Getting Started

### For Beginners
1. Start with [Test-Driven Development](./tdd) to understand the TDD workflow
2. Practice the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
3. Learn [Test Doubles](./test-doubles) for isolating code under test

### For Experienced Developers
1. Refine your TDD practice
2. Master different types of test doubles
3. Apply patterns to complex scenarios
4. Mentor others in testing practices
